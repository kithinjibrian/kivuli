# CONTEXT.md — kivuli

Session handoff file. Updated at the end of every session.
Read at the start of the next session alongside CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, and DECISIONS.md.

Every session has a name and a state: open | closed.
A session is closed only after CONTEXT.md is committed (and pushed, once a remote exists).

## SESSION 1 — 2026-10-17 — Context system setup — closed

Branch: main

### WHAT WAS DONE

Set up the context system from `docs/setup.md`, adapted to a Lugha library package rather than the guide's TypeScript defaults. The content comes from the kickoff brief (`../KICKOFF.md`, copied to `docs/source/stakeholder/kickoff-2026-10-16.md`) and lugha's own `CLAUDE.md`. Initialised the git repository on `main` (local only, no remote).

Found while setting up:
- `src/` is empty. `examples/hello.la` (a `lughac init --lib` scaffold) imports `kivuli.kivuli`, which doesn't exist, so `lughac check` fails with E0312. It is left in place for PRP-001 to replace.
- The brief's prerequisite milestones 91–92 (struct update, variants as functions) were taken in lugha by green threads (91, done) and actors (92, lugha session 214, open). Neither prerequisite is built. Recorded as DECISION-001.
- An empty `tests/` directory appeared during the session (not created by this session). `test/` is the planned test folder. Ask the user whether to remove `tests/`.

### FILES CREATED OR MODIFIED

```
CLAUDE.md                     — behavioral rules for a Lugha/GTK package
MEMORY.md                     — decisions 1–12 from the brief + handler-Ref trick + gtk.raw
CONTEXT.md                    — this log
DECISIONS.md                  — DECISION-001…004 open, 005…007 deferred
CHANGELOG.md                  — started
.llmignore, .claude/settings.json — protected paths
.gitignore                    — built example executables added
PRPs/TEMPLATE.md, PRPs/DISCOVERY.md — PRP template and discovery protocol
docs/CODE_STYLE.md            — /** */ doc comments, why-comments
docs/DESIGN.md                — style vocabulary → GTK CSS classes and properties
docs/setup.md                 — moved from ./setup.md
docs/source/stakeholder/kickoff-2026-10-16.md — copy of ../KICKOFF.md
docs/{specs,decisions,incidents,status}/, docs/source/*/, reports/, test/ — empty, with .gitkeep
```

### TESTS WRITTEN

- None (no code).

### DECISIONS MADE

- Tests live in `test/` (from the brief's layout), mirroring `src/`, headless only.
- File size limit 500 lines (brief §8).
- Sessions close on commit until a remote exists, because pushing is outward-facing and needs the user's go.

### PENDING DECISIONS OPENED

- DECISION-001: wait for the Lugha prerequisites or start kivuli now.
- DECISION-002: shape of `lazy` (R1). DECISION-003: `ui.testing` module path. DECISION-004: where the extra externs live.

### STILL OPEN AT CLOSE

- `examples/hello.la` fails to check (E0312).
- No LICENSE, README, or remote yet.
- Stray empty `tests/` directory.

## NEXT SESSION START POINT

1. Open session 2 in this file and commit it.
2. Read CLAUDE.md, MEMORY.md, DECISIONS.md, then `docs/source/stakeholder/kickoff-2026-10-16.md` (§5 internals, §6 risks).
3. Ask the user to resolve DECISION-001. Recommended: run PRP-001 discovery now, and decide on the prerequisites once lugha's actors milestone (92) closes.
4. Run the discovery interview for **PRP-001: kivuli v1** (`PRPs/DISCOVERY.md`, a recommended answer on every question), then write `PRPs/prp-001-kivuli_v1.md`. Plan the build in the brief's eight steps, each ending in something that runs:
   1. static render: `sandbox`, `text`/`button`/`column`/`row`, full rebuild per message
   2. diff + patch + the handler-`Ref` trick
   3. `input`, `checkbox`, `keyed_column`, `scroll`, `spacer`, `separator`
   4. modifiers and styles
   5. `application` with `Cmd`/`Sub`
   6. `lazy` (DECISION-002)
   7. `ui.testing` (DECISION-003)
   8. examples (counter, to-do, stopwatch) and README
5. Gotchas: kivuli uses `gtk.raw`, not `gtk.widgets`. Check every new extern against `/usr/include/gtk-4.0`. `lughac spec` before assuming any language feature.

## SESSION 2 — 2026-10-17 — Step 0: a raw GTK window — open

Branch: main

Notes so far (handoff to be written at close):
- lughac bugs to report in the lugha repo (not fixed here, per SCOPE RULE):
  1. `lughac fmt` exits 2 ("failed verification") on a `match` where a `{ … }` arm is followed by an arm starting with `(`: it drops the comma after the block, and `} (a, _) =>` then parses as a call. Repro: `fun f(x: i64, y: i64): i64 = match (x, y) { (0, _) => { 1 }, (a, _) => a, };` — runs fine, fmt crashes. Avoided in src/diff.la by moving the block into `diff_button`.
  2. `lughac fmt` puts a lone trailing array argument on one line and splits the signature (`fun view(\n    m: Model,\n): View<Msg> = column(\n    [a, b, c],\n);`) instead of hugging `column([` … `])`. Every kivuli `view` looks like this.
- lughac reinstalled from lugha main (e7abc33, m94) for struct update and variants as functions; the fmt crash (1) is still present there.
- lughac bug (3): a package whose `[link]` table has `pkg-config = ["gtk4"]` can't also list `c` files: lughac runs `pkg-config --cflags gtk4`, which prints `-mfpmath=sse -msse -msse2`, and E0329 rejects any cflag but -I/-D/-pthread instead of dropping it. Blocks lugha-gtk shipping a C wrapper for variadic `g_signal_emit_by_name` (Lugha can't declare variadics), so gtk.raw has no way to emit a signal. Fix is in lugha `src/link/` and needs the user's security review there.
- lugha-gtk: examples/test formatted (964324d, committed, not pushed); the user had already pushed src/ formatting (41ff852).
